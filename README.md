# cradle

`cradle` is a command-line tool designed to manage command-line tool made by Swift.

## Concept

cradle is very highly inspired by [nest](https://github.com/mtj0928/nest).

### Why not use nest?

nest is an excellent tool, but due to differences in approach, such as not extracting license files included in the artifact bundle, I created cradle.
